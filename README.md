# Game2048
the implemenation of the classical game 2048

## Get Started

``./2048.js`` is a library implementing the core logic of Game 2048. There are two simple examples to use this library in both terminal and browser: ``TestinTerminal.js`` is a sample to use the library in terminal, whereas the directory ``./app`` is a sample to implement the game in browser, with react.js interacting with this libaray. 

### Run in terminal
```
node TestinTerminal.js
```

Use ``w, a, s, d`` as operations.

### Run in browser

```
cd app/
npm install
npm start
```

Use ``keyUp, keyRight, keyDown, keyLeft`` as operations.
